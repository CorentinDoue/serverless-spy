# Roadmap

The following additional features are in development but with no timeframe.
 - Support for Kinesis
 - Support for Step Functions ðŸŒŸ
 - Support for [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) in addition to [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) (note: You can already use Vitest or any other testing framework. There is just no deep integration with it.)

Let me know what should be [prioritized](https://twitter.com/ServerlessL).
